# IIT Goa Elections 2018 Online Software

### Developers 
+ Shivam Pandey - BACK END 
+ Abhishek Varghese - FRONT END


## Objective
This software was developed and implemented to replace the former "Ballot Box" system, to conduct the elections in more convenient and eco-friendly manner(Say NO to Papers ðŸ˜‡)


## How does the Voter handle this Election Software ?

- The Main Code through which the Software runs is [application.py](https://github.com/AbhishekVarghese/Elections_IITGoa/blob/master/Code/Application.py).  
- Firstly, the voter needs to give his/her branch like CSE, EE, ME.
- Then after proceeding , the voter must provide his/her "IIT Goa email address".
- Then, a 6 or 7 digit OTP is sent from "electionsiitgoa2018@gmail.com" to the given email address.
- This particular OTP is typed by the voter in the front end window of the software and then he/she has the access to cast their votes.

## Behind The Scenes

- *Python 2/Python 3* : Used to develop Front End & Back End. 
- *Tkinter Library* : Used to develop the Front End Software Window.
- *SMTP Server* : Used to send OTP from "electionsiitgoa2018@gmail.com" to respective emails IDs.
- *Pickle* : It was used for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure. Any object in python can be pickled so that it can be saved on disk.

## Security Checks

- We made sure that **a particular email address can be used ONLY once** to vote.
- Incase of Internet failure, we have put up backup options to bypass a particular page.
- All bypass passcodes were known to only the developers of the software during elections.

## Motivation

- We got the motivation from Prof. Rishikesh Narayan and Dr. Appaji to conduct the elections for this year online.
- After the elections are done, we have put up all the data files on GitHub to make it public so that everyone is assured of the transparency in the Election procedure.
